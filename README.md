python tools for hacking chasm: the rift

# why
because its fun! and to help people in future interested in looking at the chasm: the rift data files

# what

chasm.py -- this is just my worksheet for experimenting with the data
binfile.py -- this is a wrapper for interacting with "CSM.BIN"
palette.py -- this reads a chasm palette file into a usable format
texture.py -- this reads texture data "*.CEL" and can export as a PIL Image (if provided a palette file)
